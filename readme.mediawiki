= cl-csv =

This library aims to simplify working with csvs to the bare minimum of tedium

* reads/writes csvs from/to strings and streams
* support streaming reads (allowing processing very large csvs, through read-csv's row-fn paramter)
* supports custom data formating
* settable quote, separator and quote-escapes
* supports multiline quoted data
